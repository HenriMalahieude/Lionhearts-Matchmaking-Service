# Lionhearts-Matchmaking-Service
Designed and programmed in June of 2021, this server handled the queue for matchmaking into Team Deathmatch. I was the primary programmer, however I was following the guidance of Credenzio Studios' Technical Lead.

Purpose:
1. Interact with the game through Https requests in order to match players of similar skills into a single game
2. Interact with the game to set up these 'private servers' so they match the filters that the players chose
3. Have expandability to higher numbers of players past 1v1s, allow new/different gamemodes other than Team Deathmatch, and choice of map
